# Youtube Title Prediction Using PySpark

## Problem Statement
Indonesia is a really big nation with more than 200 million inhabitants, this make this country is one of the biggest market for many digital platform such as Youtube, Instagram, Facebook and many others. By this repository, I would like to try to predict which title on Youtube that perform best as seen on its views.

## Dataset
I collected the data based on top 45 youtube channel rank in [socialblade.com](https://socialblade.com/youtube/top/country/id) as per May 2019. And then we export each of channel video data using [youtube data tools](https://tools.digitalmethods.net/netvizz/youtube/).And then I putted it into Big Query cause the data is pretty large (400-500MB)
